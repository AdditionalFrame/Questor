  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:
	 - Merged Da_Teach's Incursion 1.6 fix to DirectEve.dll

May 30, 2011:
  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:
	 - Added in code to check for acceleration gates during salvage because pockets didn't despawn
		 on mission turn-in.  bool <useGatesInSalvage> in char.xml determines behavior when gates
		 detected; if false, Questor salvages any ships in first pocket, then quits salvaging and
		 returns to base.  If true, Questor salvages, then proceeds through the gates, salvaging as
		 it goes.
	 - Attempt to fix issue with the Questor window occasionally disappearing, leaving Questor running
		 but with no ability to control it.

  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:
	 - Merged in Ganondorf's fitting swap code
		= Be sure to set up a "default" fitting in the fitting manager; this will be what is used
			if no fitting specified
		= fittings are specified in <charname>.xml.  Examples are given in the included charname.xml
			sample file
		= Mission specific fittings that also match the enemy faction are given highest priority.
			Next comes mission specific fittings that have no attached faction
			Next comes faction specific fittings
			Finally, if no other fittings matched, the default fitting is used
	 - Fixed swap code to switch to default if it can't find the specified fitting

  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:
	 - Revamped last changes to scheduler
		= Scheduler now reads <Schedules.xml> to get start, stop, and run times
		= Command line is back to normal behavior by default; if only one argument specified,
			assumes it's character name and checks <Schedules.xml> for a schedule for that
			character
	 - <Schedules.xml>
		= MUST have user, pw, and name defined or will not log in
		= Times should be military time in HH:MM format
		= If start is not specified, starts immediately
		= If current time is past start time by less than 12 hours, starts immediately;
			otherwise waits for start time to roll around again
		= If stop time comes before start time (i.e. start = 21:00, stop = 05:45), stop time
			occurs the next day
		= If runtime is specified, it overrides stop time and starts from the time Questor is
			actually started. (if start = 21:00, stop = 05:45, runtime = 4, and we run Questor
			at 22:15, Questor will start immediately and run for 4 hours, quitting at first idle
			state after 02:15 next morning)
		= Currently you can only have one schedule per character; you can't start and stop each
			character multiple times per day.  By "currently", I mean "for the forseeable future",
			as I have no pressing need to run my characters multiple times, I'm lazy, and I can't
			be arsed to work multiple schedules into the code.
		

May 21, 2011:
  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:
    - Added command-line start time, stop time, and runtime.
    - Changed the existing command line args; new args:
		= -user <username>
		= -pw <password>
		= -char <character name>
		= -start <start time>
		= -stop <stop time>
		= -run <runtime in hours>
		Old command line of <user> <pw> <char> <autorun> will no longer work!
		Theoretically, start and stop times can be in any format recognizable
		 by DateTime.Parse.  I've been using military time in HH:MM and have
		 had no problems.
		Currently, if start time is more than 12 hours out, bot assumes we
		 missed the start time and starts immediately.  If we've already passed
		 the stop time, bot adds a day to the stop time.
		Once stop time is reached, bot will quit upon next idle state


March 11, 2011:
  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:
    
    - Added mission decline delay timer.  <char>.xml toggle is
      <waitDecline>true</waitDecline>

    - Added faction blacklist. Faction blacklist in <char>.xml is
      <factionblacklist>
           <faction>Caldari State</faction>
           <faction>Gallente Federation</faction>
           <faction>Whatever Else</faction>
      </factionblacklist>
