  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:
    - Added command-line start time, stop time, and runtime.
    - Changed the existing command line args; new args:
		= -user <username>
		= -pw <password>
		= -char <character name>
		= -start <start time>
		= -stop <stop time>
		= -run <runtime in hours>
		Old command line of <user> <pw> <char> <autorun> will no longer work!
		Theoretically, start and stop times can be in any format recognizable
		 by DateTime.Parse.  I've been using military time in HH:MM and have
		 had no problems.
		Currently, if start time is more than 12 hours out, bot assumes we
		 missed the start time and starts immediately.  If we've already passed
		 the stop time, bot adds a day to the stop time.
